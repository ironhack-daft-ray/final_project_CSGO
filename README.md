### Game Introduction - CSGO

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) is a first-person shooter that has become a global phenomenon and one of the hallmarks of the esport world. 

**GAME OBJECTIVE:**

In Competitive Demolition Mode, two teams of 5 players each battle each: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists.
- As a Terrorist you are tasked with eliminating the opposition or planting the C4 bomb before the round time limit is reached and securing its detonation.
- As a Counter-Terrorist you are tasked with eliminating the opposition, defusing the bomb if planted, or stalling the Terrorist attack long enough until the round time limit is reached.  

**GAME LENGHT:**

Matches are played as over a maximum of 30 rounds, the first team to secure 16 rounds wins the game. At the end of the 15th round the two teams switch sides.

In regular matchmaking, if both teams secure 15 rounds then the match ends in a tie, however, in professional play and competitive leagues, the match will continue to an overtime.

**GAME ECONOMICS:**

Players start out a match with a specified amount, and will receive more as the match goes on by getting kills or going for the objectives. Money can then be used at the start of rounds to buy weapons and equipment, any residual money is taken over to the next round (reset at side-switch) to a maximum of $16000.
